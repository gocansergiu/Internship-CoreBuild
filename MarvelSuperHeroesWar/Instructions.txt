How it works
-----------------------
After you open the application, it will automatically appear all the Characters(nr,name,attack,hp,isvillain and description) 
and Planets(nr,name,modifiers and description).
After the details the app will ask for an integer input which is the nr(ID) of a planet, shown in description.
The next step will ask you :Do you want to assemble Avengers?, if you press 1 (for yes) the avengers 
team will start assemble by pressing the ID number(nr) of the super-heroes and once you got the desired team, 
you press 0 to finish the assembling, if you press 0(for no) you will pick just a super-hero
and the fight will be 1v1 .
The last step is picking the villain by pressing the nr(id) of the villain you wish to fight.
After that, the details of the fight will appear ( attack and health after the planet modifiers, and the names).
The fight begins with the villain hitting the hero and vice-versa, until one of them reaches 0 or negative health.
