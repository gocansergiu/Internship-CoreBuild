Marvel superheroes wars
-----------------------
SPECIFICATIONS:

Create a simple console application or HTML page that can simulate fights between heroes and villains.
You can use C#, Java, Kotlin, HTML, Javascript or any other language, as long as you provide a working
 sample and instructions (.JAR, .EXE, .HTML) that can be executed
without requiring an IDE setup to build the project.

You are given 2 input files planets & characters (JSON & XML) which contain the data for the program.
Each character has an initial health, and attack stats, and a flag indicating if this character is a hero or villain.
Each planet contains health & attack modifiers for villains and heroes, that are applied before the fight begins.

At runtime, the user should be able to select from the console/UI a planet, a villain and a superhero.
After this the fight begins, and the villain and hero attack turn by turn until someone's health reaches 0.
The damage that a character does each round is random, and it varies from 60% to 100% of his attack stats.

BONUS REQUIREMENT(optional):
Since most villains are more powerful than heroes, you could allow the user to create an 'Avengers' team, 
that contain multiple heroes to defeat a villain.



What we are expecting from you:
-the source code for the application, either bundled in a ZIP, or committed into a GitHub repo that is public and we can access
-a file that can be executed, and instructions to run it (.JAR , .EXE, .HTML )
-since .JAR and .EXE can't be sent as attachments, please upload those to a file sharing service like DropBox
-points will be awarded for simplicity of usage of the application, correctness of solution, lack of bugs,
 usage of OOP practices and cleanness of the final solution.
